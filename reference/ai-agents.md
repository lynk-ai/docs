# AI Agents

## Providing the right context and right tools

For AI agents to be effective, they require both the right context and the right tools.

**Context** means understanding the business: what a “customer” is, how “revenue” is calculated, and how different entities relate.&#x20;

**Tools** refer to the ability to access clean, modeled data, generate new features on the fly, and trace logic across layers.

Lynk provides both. \
It acts as a semantic brain - mapping business concepts to data, enabling composable logic through feature chaining, and giving AI agents a governed, structured environment to operate in confidently and accurately.

More on AI agents enablement coming soon.\
We are soon releasing a full suite of feature that enable agents work smoothly with Lynk: RAG including support to documents on a vector db (for sample Queries, for example), advanced tooling exposed via MCP and more.
