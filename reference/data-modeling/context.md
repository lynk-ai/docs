# Context

Contexts are business domains like marketing, sales, product, customer success etc.

## Default context

Lynk comes with one context - the `core` context. Unless created on a custom context, features will be created on this context and will be available to all&#x20;

## Custom contexts

Add custom context

## Entities

Entities on Lynk are defined once and available on all contexts.

## Access to contexts

You can define which roles have access to specific contexts

## Usage and use cases
