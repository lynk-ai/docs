# Introduction

Lynk is the Semantic Layer for business and data teams, empowering them to create a central source of truth in a trusted and accessible way, while enabling data consumption through modern AI-powered applications.

## Core concepts&#x20;

Lynk Semantic Layer was built into the era of AI, with business teams in mind. \
It makes defining and consuming semantic / business definitions much more accessible to non technical users, as well as enforcing strong data modeling and governance features to keep the source of truth structurally strong and trusted.&#x20;

Lynk is designed to give the **power,** the **freedom** and the **flexibility** to each member of the data supply chain to produce and explore the data they need when they need it. \
Lowering cross-team dependencies (and ad hoc requests), while keeping the companyâ€™s data organized in a central source of truth that is highly accessible.

The product's core concepts are:

### **Accessibility**

Lynk is suitable to both business users and data teams. \
All the semantic definitions like Entities and Features are available to view and edit via Lynk Studio - a user friendly data catalog and glossary where anyone can access and create data in a simple yet governed manner.

### **Data modeling**

At its core, Lynk has a structured data modeling framework.\
Data is modeled as entities and features in a way that is highly accessible for business users and AI, and makes it simpler to overcome common challenges like "how should I model this data" and "was this already done before?"

Visit [data modeling](reference/data-modeling/) for in-depth information about this.

### **Governance**

Entities, features and usage patterns are all constantly governed.\
To make sure our source of truth is trusted and avoid duplicated logic and wasted resources.

Visit [governance](reference/governance.md) for in-depth information about this.

### **Version control**

Everything built on Lynk translates to code and is version controlled, even if built via the Studio. \
Apply coding best practices, CI/CD and tests to semantic definitions - while letting business users and analysts move fast.

Visit [Git integration](reference/integrations/git.md) for in-depth information about this.

### **Efficiency**

Efficiency is critical for query performance and reducing cost.\
Semantic definitions are translated to efficient SQL code. Lynk also governs usage patterns to suggest improvements.

### **AI first**

Lynk is built from the ground up with AI in mind.\
Coming soon: AI will empower users to build, explain, and consume entities, features, and data insights.
