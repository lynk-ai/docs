# Introduction

Lynk is the Semantic Layer for business and data teams.\
Enabling teams to create a central source of truth for each of the entities in the business - in a trusted and accessible way.

#### The core concepts of Lynk as a semantic layer;

## **Accessibility**

Lynk is suitable to both business users and data teams. \
All the semantic definitions like Entities and Features are available to view and edit via Lynk studio - a user friendly UI.

## [**Data modeling**](reference/data-modeling/)

At it's core, Lynk has a structured data modeling framework.\
Data is modeled as entities and features in a way that makes it simpler to overcome common challenges like "how should I model this data" and "was this already done before?"

## [**Governance**](reference/governance.md)

Entities, features and usage patterns are all constantly governed.\
To make sure our source of truth is trusted and avoid duplicated logic and wasted resources.

## **Version control**

Everything built on Lynk translates to code and is version controlled, even if built via the Studio. \
Apply coding best practices, CI/CD and tests to semantics definitions - while letting business users and analysts move fast.

## **Efficiency**

Efficiency is critical for query performance and reducing cost.\
Semantic definitions are translated to efficient SQL code. Lynk also governs usage patterns to suggest improvements.

## **AI first**

Lynk is built from the ground up with AI in mind.\
AI helps Lynk users to build, explain and consume entities, features and insights.
