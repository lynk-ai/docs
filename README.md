## Semantic Layer

## Governance



## Position in the stack







Lynk is a new kind of a Semantic Layer for data teams, business teams, and AI.\
Create a unified central source of truth of your data, get consistent results across tools, and enable AI apps with the right context.&#x20;

Lynk puts your business entities and their features at the center. Separating between the logical layer and the consumption layer makes the experience of interacting with the Semantic Layer much more dynamic and flexible, while keeping the source of truth core logic.&#x20;

**Semantic Layer**\
Connect all the data silos to create a unified central source of truth to get consistent results. \
At it's core, Lynk Semantic Layer has a robust data modeling framework that models data around business entities and features - each business entity is a business domain and it's features represent everything we know about this entity. Lynk makes it easy to add features and connect entity relations while keeping the resulting code clean, efficient and governed.

**Governance**\
As the business evolves, more entities and features are being added. Lynk governs all these additions to make sure no duplicates are being made and the code is kept clean and efficient - and the source of truth remains a real single source of truth.

**Accessibility and collaboration**\
Accessing business entities and features is super simple via a business friendly catalog - Lynk Studio. \
All the business definitions are accessible to data teams, business users and AI - via a simple UI or API.

## Concepts

### Code first

Lynk is code first, meaning everything can be done via code (YAML files) and version control (GIT) is fully supported.&#x20;

### Lynk Studio

Lynk Studio is a modern data catalog that enables anyone build and consume features and entities. It creates a shared and simple place where people can collaborate with data and keep things simple and clear. \
The Studio is tightly coupled to code, meaning everything you do on the Studio translates to code and vice versa.&#x20;
