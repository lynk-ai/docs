# Entity YAML Reference

Entity YAML files define the features, metrics, join rules, and examples for a single business entity.

{% hint style="info" %}
**First time here?** If you haven't read the other file-type docs yet, start with [knowledge-md.md](./knowledge-md.md) to understand the scoping model, then [task-instructions-md.md](./task-instructions-md.md) for SQL guidance patterns — both are shorter and establish context this file builds on. Come back here when you're ready to model entities.

## Quick Reference — Feature Types

| Type | What it does | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `field` | Pulls a column directly from a source table | Any direct attribute — name, status, amount |
| `metric` | Aggregates from a related entity (feature chaining) | Per-entity totals — total revenue, order count |
| `first_last` | Gets the first or last value ordered by another field | Most recent plan, first order date |
| `formula` | Derives a value from other features on the same entity | Ratios, tiers, days-since calculations |

Each type is documented in detail below.

## Name and Description

When a user asks a question, the agent decides which entities are relevant based on their `name` and `description`. These are the two fields the agent reads first — before looking at features or metrics.

**`name`** is the entity identifier. It appears in queries (`entity('order')`), in relationships, and in metric feature references. Keep it short, lowercase, and unambiguous.

**`description`** is what the agent uses to decide whether this entity is relevant to the question. A vague description means the agent may miss the entity entirely or pick the wrong one. A good description answers:
- What does this entity represent?
- What questions or topics is it used for?

```yaml
# TOO VAGUE — agent has no signal for when to use this
name: order
description: Order data

# GOOD — agent knows what this is and when it applies
name: order
description: >
  A completed purchase transaction. Use this entity for questions about
  revenue, order volume, purchase dates, and product-level sales.
```

```yaml
# TOO VAGUE
name: session
description: Session information

# GOOD
name: session
description: >
  A single user visit to the product. Use this entity for questions about
  engagement, retention, feature usage, and user behavior.
```

If your project has multiple entities that could answer similar questions (e.g., `order` and `order_item`), the description is how the agent chooses between them. Be explicit about what the entity represents and what questions it answers.

---

## The `source` Field

Every feature (except `formula`) has a `source` field that tells the agent where to get the data. `source` always means "where this data comes from" — it can be a warehouse table or an entity.

| Feature type | `source` can be | Format |
|---|---|---|
| `field` | A warehouse table/view or an entity | `schema.db.table` or entity name |
| `first_last` | A warehouse table/view or an entity | `schema.db.table` or entity name |
| `metric` | An entity only | entity name (e.g., `order`) |
| `formula` | — | No `source` — references features on this entity |

`metric` features require an entity as `source` because they need aggregation logic (`metrics:`) that only exists on entities, not on raw tables.

When `source` is an entity (for `field` and `first_last` features), the join between the two entities must be defined in `entities_relationships.yml`. Specify which join to use with `join_name` if more than one join exists for that entity pair.

---

## Feature Types

### `field` — Direct Column

Pulls a column from a source table without aggregation.

```yaml
- type: field
  name: full_name
  data_type: string
  source: db_prod.public.customer
  description: Customer's full name
  field: full_name
```

```yaml
- type: field
  name: status
  data_type: string
  source: db_prod.public.customer_info
  description: Current account status — 'active', 'churned', or 'trial'
  field: account_status
  join_name: account_id     # use when source is a related_source, not the key_source
```

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `name` | Feature name — what users see and query |
| `data_type` | `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `datetime` |
| `source` | The source table this field comes from |
| `field` | The column name in the source table (may differ from `name`) |
| `join_name` | Which join to use when `source` is a `related_source`. Omit if using the key_source. |
| `filters` | Pre-filters applied to the source before retrieving the field. Omit if no filters. |

---

### `metric` — Aggregated Value from a Related Entity

Pulls an aggregated value from a metric defined on a **related entity**. This is feature chaining.

```yaml
- type: metric
  name: total_revenue
  description: Total revenue from all orders placed by this customer
  data_type: number
  source: order
  metric: sum_amount
```

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `source` | The related entity whose metric to use (entity name, not a raw table) |
| `metric` | The metric name from the related entity's `metrics:` section |
| `join_name` | Which relationship join to use. Omit to use the default join for this entity pair. |
| `filters` | Pre-filters applied to the related entity before aggregating. Omit if no filters. |

**With filters:**

```yaml
- type: metric
  name: revenue_2025
  description: Total revenue from orders placed in 2025
  data_type: number
  source: order
  filters:
    - type: sql
      sql: "{source}.{order_date} >= '2025-01-01' and {source}.{order_date} <= '2025-12-31'"
  metric: sum_amount
```

```yaml
- type: metric
  name: enterprise_orders_count
  description: Number of orders from enterprise-tier customers
  data_type: number
  source: order
  filters:
    - type: sql
      sql: "{source}.{customer_tier} = 'enterprise'"
  metric: count_orders
```

Filters use a `sql` expression. Reference the entity's fields with `{source}.{field_name}`.

**Important:** For `metric` features, `source` must be an entity name (e.g., `order`), not a raw table name (e.g., `db_prod.core.orders`). The `metric:` you reference is defined in that entity's `metrics:` section — raw tables don't have metrics.

---

### `first_last` — First or Last Value from a Source

Retrieves the first or last value from a set of rows, ordered by a specified field. Useful for "most recent plan", "first order date", "signup source".

```yaml
- type: first_last
  name: first_order_date
  description: Date of the customer's first order
  data_type: datetime
  source: order
  join_name: customer_to_order
  options:
    method: first
    sort_by: order_date
    field: order_date
    data_type: datetime
```

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `method` | `first` = smallest sort value; `last` = largest sort value |
| `sort_by` | The field to order rows by before selecting |
| `field` | The field to return from that row |
| `offset` | Optional. Which position to take — `1` returns the first/last row, `2` returns the second-from-first/last, etc. Defaults to `1` if omitted. |

---

### `formula` — Derived Value

Computes a value from other features on the same entity. References other features using `{feature_name}` syntax.

```yaml
- type: formula
  name: days_since_signup
  data_type: number
  description: Number of days since this customer signed up
  sql: DATEDIFF('day', {signup_date}, CURRENT_DATE)
```

```yaml
- type: formula
  name: revenue_per_order
  data_type: number
  description: Average revenue per order for this customer
  sql: CASE WHEN {total_orders} > 0 THEN {total_revenue} / {total_orders} ELSE 0 END
```

Formula features can reference any feature on the same entity — `field`, `first_last`, `formula`, or `metric`. They cannot reference features on other entities.

---

## Entity Metrics

Entity metrics define how to aggregate rows of this entity. They are the targets of metric features on other entities.

```yaml
metrics:
  - name: sum_amount
    description: Total order amount across all rows
    sql: SUM({amount})

  - name: count_orders
    description: Total number of orders
    sql: COUNT({order_id})

  - name: avg_order_value
    description: Average order value
    sql: AVG({amount})
```

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `name` | Metric identifier — referenced by `metric(name)` in queries |
| `description` | Explains what it measures and how to use it |
| `sql` | Aggregation SQL expression. References entity features with `{feature_name}`. |

**Entities are the source of truth.** Raw warehouse tables are inputs — they exist to enrich entities, not to be queried directly. Metrics are defined on entities because entities are where business meaning lives. A raw table has columns; an entity has features, definitions, and metrics that the agent can reason about.

If you need a metric on data that currently lives only in a raw table, you have two options:

1. **Create a new entity** from that table — if the table's level of granularity doesn't exist as an entity yet. Define the entity, bring in the fields as features, and add the metric there.

2. **Use an existing entity** — if an entity already exists at the same level of granularity, create a relationship between that entity and the raw table, bring the fields in as features via `related_sources`, and define the metric as a rollup on those features.

In both cases, the metric ends up on an entity — which is the only place the agent can find and use it.

---

## `related_sources`

Declares secondary warehouse tables used by `field` and `first_last` features. Each entry defines the join condition from the entity's `key_source` to the secondary table.

**When should a warehouse table become an entity vs. a `related_source`?**

Start with the question: *what level of granularity does this table represent?*

**Create a new entity** if:
- The table represents a business concept at its own level of granularity — something with real business meaning that you'd want to ask questions about on its own (e.g., `order`, `subscription`, `session`)
- You need to aggregate rows from it — metrics can only be defined on entities, not on raw sources. If you're counting rows, summing a value, or computing an average from this table, it needs to be an entity
- Other entities need to relate to it via the relationship graph

**Use `related_sources`** if:
- The table is an enrichment — it adds columns to an existing entity but doesn't represent a different level of granularity
- It contains no business logic of its own that you'd aggregate or query independently
- You only need `field` or `first_last` features from it — no metrics

**How to pick the `key_source` for an entity:**

A table is the right `key_source` for an entity if it contains *all* instances of the concept and each instance appears exactly once. For a `customer` entity, the `customers` table where every customer has exactly one row is the right `key_source`. Other tables at the same customer level (e.g., a CRM enrichment table with one row per customer) connect as `related_sources`. Tables at a finer granularity (e.g., orders, one row per order per customer) connect as relationships — they can be aggregated up to the customer level via metric features.


```yaml
related_sources:
  db_prod.public.customer_details:
    relationship: one_to_one
    description: Extended customer info including billing address and plan details
    joins:
      - name: customer_id
        default: true
        type: sql
        sql: "{source}.{id} = {destination}.{customer_id}"
```

**Join types for related_sources:**

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| `sql` | Explicit SQL join condition using `{source}` and `{destination}` |
| `lookup` | Multi-hop join through intermediate tables |

---

## When to Use This File

Create or update an entity YAML file when a concept meets one of these conditions:
1. You're modeling a new business concept the agent should be able to query
2. You're adding or changing a metric, feature, or dimension on an existing entity
3. The agent produces wrong results for a specific entity — field choices, joins, or calculations need fixing

**Examples:**
- "We want the agent to answer questions about orders — revenue, volume, channel performance" → create an `order` entity
- "Users keep asking about customer health but there's no entity for it yet — model `customer` with ARR, NPS, and churn status" → create a `customer` entity
- "Add a new metric to `customer` — total revenue from the last 90 days" → add a filtered metric feature to the existing entity
- "The agent is joining the wrong table for revenue questions — there are two revenue fields and it keeps picking the wrong one" → add entity-level task instructions and improve feature descriptions
- "We onboarded a new data source for product usage — model it as a `session` entity so the agent can answer engagement questions" → create a new entity from the source table

---

## Best Practices

**Write descriptions that tell the agent when to use this entity.** The agent selects entities based on `name` and `description` — a vague description means missed or wrong matches. Answer: what does this entity represent, and what questions should it answer?

**Write feature descriptions that tell the agent when to use a field.** When two date fields exist on an entity (e.g., `created_at` and `completed_at`), the description should state which one to use for filtering — for example, "use this for all date filtering, not `created_at`".

**Define entity metrics before referencing them in metric features on other entities.** Metric features on `customer` that reference `order` metrics depend on those metrics being defined on the `order` entity. Build the source entity first.

**Prefer metric features for cross-entity aggregation.** If you need a per-customer revenue total, define it as a metric feature — not a formula that approximates it. Metric features use the relationship join; formulas do not.

**Use `first_last` for single values from a many-side entity.** If you need "most recent order date" on `customer`, use `first_last` — not a formula. Formulas cannot aggregate across rows.

**Keep `key_source` as the primary grain table.** Enrichment from secondary tables belongs in `related_sources`. The `key_source` defines the entity's identity — one row = one entity instance.

---

## Common Pitfalls

{% hint style="danger" %}
Avoid these common pitfalls when defining entity features and metrics.
{% endhint %}

**Using a raw table name in a metric feature's `source`**
```yaml
# WRONG
- type: metric
  source: db_prod.core.orders    # this is a source table, not an entity
  metric: sum_amount

# RIGHT
- type: metric
  source: order                  # this is the entity name
  metric: sum_amount
```

**Defining metrics on related_sources**
Sources cannot have metrics. If you need to aggregate from a source, create an entity whose `key_source` is that table, define the metrics on the entity, then use a metric feature.

**Circular formula references**
Formula features can only reference features that are already computed at the same level. A formula cannot reference another formula that references it back.

**Missing relationship for a metric feature**
Metric features require a relationship between the two entities in `entities_relationships.yml`. If the relationship does not exist, the metric feature cannot be resolved.

---

## Full Examples

These examples cover three different companies. Example 1 is Grove (B2B SaaS) — the `customer` entity, which uses metric features to pull subscription data from the `subscription` entity. Example 2 is Bly (e-commerce) — the `order` entity, standalone with its own metrics. Example 3 is Arcadia (mobile gaming) — the `player` entity, which uses metric features from `purchase` and formula-based segmentation. Reading all three shows the same pattern — entity metrics → feature chaining → query examples — in three distinct business contexts.

---

### Example 1 — Grove (B2B SaaS), `customer` entity

The `customer` entity includes metric features from the `subscription` entity (active subscription count and total MRR). The `customer-subscription` relationship must be defined in `entities_relationships.yml` for these features to resolve.

```yaml
name: customer
description: >
  A paying customer account at Grove. Use this entity for questions about ARR,
  churn, plan type, customer tier, NPS, and account health. For subscription-level
  detail (billing cycle, cancellation dates, MRR per subscription), use the subscription entity.

### Example 2 — Bly (E-commerce), `order` entity

```yaml
name: order

  A purchase transaction at Bly. Use this entity for questions about revenue,
  order volume, average order value, channel performance, and refund rates.
  For product-level questions (best-selling SKUs, category performance), use the product entity
  joined through order_items.

### Example 3 — Arcadia (Mobile gaming), `player` entity

This example shows formula-based segmentation (`player_segment` derived from rolling 30-day spend), two metric features from `purchase` (lifetime and filtered), and a MEDIUM query that identifies high-value players at churn risk. The `player-purchase` relationship must be defined in `entities_relationships.yml` for the metric features to resolve.

```yaml
name: player
description: >
  A registered Arcadia player who has completed at least one game session. Use this entity
  for questions about player counts, activity, spend, segmentation, and D7 retention.
  For session-level metrics (session length, level reached), use the session entity.
  For purchase-level detail, use the purchase entity.
